# 2025-09-3 - Brainstorming & RFA
First meeting to come up with potential ideas for senior design project.
- Initial Ideas:
  - 3D Printed Battle Bots - join the battle bot competition with professor gruev
  - Pill Sorter - automatically sort pills by days needed
  - Automatic Frozen Fish Feeder - keeps fish food frozen and automatically feeds the fish
  -nd  MTD Bus Visual - Live feed of the buses on campus ashows them on PCB/3D printer*

- MTD Bus Tracker Project Idea:
  - live tracking every 30 sec
  - two-way LED roads along 3d printed champaign
  - maybe include brightness, themes
  - 7-segment display for time or date?
